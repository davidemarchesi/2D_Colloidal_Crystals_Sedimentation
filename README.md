# Colloids Sedimentation

This repository collects all the `MATLAB` codes developed for the analysis of a Colloidal Solution made up by Micrometric Silica particles.
Can be distinguished 2 parts:

1- The analysis of diffusion dynamics under 2D sedimentation (making an extensive use of the `MSD ANALYZER` online tool developed by Tinevez J.-Y.);

2- The post-processing and analysis of the colloidal crystals formed after sedimentation.
