# Colloids' Sedimentation

This repository collects the `MATLAB` codes developed for the analysis of a Colloidal Suspension, made up by Micrometric Silica particles,
settling in a confined 2D cell, and observed through an Optical Transmission Microscope.
It's divided in 2 parts:

1- The analysis of diffusion dynamics under 2D sedimentation (making an extensive use of the `MSD ANALYZER` online tool developed by Tinevez J.-Y.);

2- The pictures' post processing and the analysis of colloidal crystals' features such as topological defects and order parameters.

The work is developed for Davide Marchesi MSc. Thesis in Nuclear Engineering at Politecnico di Milano: A.Y. 2024-2025 - P.I. Prof. Roberto Piazza.
